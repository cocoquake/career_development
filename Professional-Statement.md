Coming from fine arts, I discovered a passion for cybersecurity after college, seeing it as a developing field where I could combine all of my strengths and passions in an evolving digital space. I plan to use my skills in design, communication and programming to protect businesses, investors and everyday people in the growing cyberspace of the modern world. I believe an organized society is a just one, governed by democratic principles and protected through secure digital infrastructure. Guided by the core values of the C.I.A. triad, cybersecurity allows me to merge my artistic insight with technical skills, positioning me as a proactive, adaptable, and mission-driven professional dedicated to keeping the web safe for all. My mission is to deliver high-quality service that fosters trust, accessibility, and safety online.
